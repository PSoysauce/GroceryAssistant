    - Will ask if they are a person who needs help or is volunteering
    - Ask them to login or create an account
        - Use firebase to create an account / authenticate account

Need Help:
1. If they need help take them to the shopping list section
    - Basic functionality is a empty list where they can put what exactly they need
        - They can also put alternatives if that item is not in stock
2. Hit submit and then it'll find a user to look for
3. Store the data in firebase
    - User name
    - address
    - phone number
    - shopping list

Volunteer:
1. Assign list from someone who needs help near them
    - get shopping list data from firebase
2. They pick up the payment method (card / cash)
3. Person goes to store and gets the items and delivers to their address
